    Do you want to create a list of all your goals and expectations followed by how you will reach those goals so you have a
    nice and relaxed <em>new</em> year?
    Hi there! I am Ava Ghavam and in the past few days, I've learned how to create beginner-level websites.
    So, with the small ability that learned, I want to put everything that I have in mind for 2021 into this wesite that you're reading.
    If you want to do the same, go ahead! Bring something that you can write on, like a notebook, a writing tool,
    like a pen or pencil and lets get started.
  </p>
  <h2>Instructions:</h2>
  <p style="font-size:19px">In order to achive this <em>perfect</em> year, just follow these easy steps below:</p>
  <ol style="font-size:18px">
    <li>Divide your page into 3 sections. One for your goals, one for your expectations, and one for your plan.</li>
    <li>On the top of your 3 sections, write <em>My Goals:</em> - <em>My Expectations:</em> - <em>My Plan:</em> (one for each).</li>
    <li>Fill up your sections!</li>
  </ol>
  <h2><p>My Goals:</p></h2>
    <p style="font-size:19px">Here are all my goals that I would like to accomplish this year: (Remember, make sure to put everything down)</p>
    <ul style="font-size:18px">
      <li>Finish the programming bootcamp</li>
      <li>Moving into the basement</li>
      <li>Get really good grades</li>
      <li>Keep my room clean until 2022</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><p>My expectations:</p></h2>
    <p style="font-size:19px">Now, write down what you expect from all your goals by the end of the year. Like so:</p>
      <ul style="font-size:18px">
        <li>Finishing the programming bootcamp - By <em><strong>March</strong></em></li>
        <li>Moving into the basement - By <em><strong>end of Augeust (or earlier)</strong></em></li>
        <li>Get really good grades - Time will tell ðŸ˜›</li>
        <li>Keep my room clean until 2022 - Time will tell ðŸ˜‹</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><p>My Plan:</p></h2>
        <p style="font-size:19px">Lastly, put down a way (or ways) on <strong><em>how</em></strong> you are going to put check beside your goals by the end of the year:</p>
        <ul style="font-size:18px">
          <li>Finishing bootcamp - By making an "after school routine" so I can get to everything that I need to do <em>and</em> continue with my bootcamp every night</li>
          <li>Moving into basement - By finishing the bootcamp and making <u>money - about $5,000 per month at least</u> ðŸ¤‘</li>
          <li>Get good grades - By studying really hard</li>
          <li>Keep room clean untill 2022 - By doing the basics ðŸ¤­(putting everything that I use away after using it, vaccum, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <p style="font-size:20px">
          To sumerize, by now you should have some writing in your 3 boxes.
          One box is for your goals for the year, one includes your expectations, and the last one is for your plan.
          Well done! I'm so proud of you! As a result, you will hopefully have a nice and relaxed year of 2021.
          Just follow your text from the plan part and you're good to go!
